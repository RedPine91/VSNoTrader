Vintage Story Mod that removes traders

This only 3 lines of code that took a few hours, and was mostly done with someone elses help.  Redistribute, upload, modify, etc. at your pleasure.

WARNING:   Any update that changes the number of entries in the "structures.txt" file in "C:\Users\jtnpa\AppData\Roaming\Vintagestory\assets\survival\worldgen" will cause this mod to delete something other than traders.

This mod has no effect on traders already generated, it only removes new traders from being generated.
